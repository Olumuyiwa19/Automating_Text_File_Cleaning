The nucleotide sequence of a long polymorphic region (positions 134-2096) located 365 bp upstream of the human insulin gene is composed of 139 repeating sequences whose consensus structure is related to 'acaggggtgtgggg'. Expansion in the number of repeating sequences appears to have taken place through duplication and triplication of blocks of 8-10 repeats. However, ancestral polymorphic regions containing additions or deletions of 50 bp or more were not detected in two previous generations. The region 168-258 bp upstream from the transcription start site, containing essential control elements for efficient cell-specific expression, are the same. Thus linkage-disequilibrium between sequences in this control region and specific polymorphic regions is probably not the explanation for the disease association between the long polymorphic regions and atherosclerosis.; Method: conceptual translation.locus HUMINSPR accession M10039.1
